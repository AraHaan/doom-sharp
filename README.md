# doom-sharp
Doom# - a Doom port made in C#.

Ever wanted a clean version of doom that is easier to compile and read the source code of?

Well here you go; A verison of Doom made in C#.

### Why? Why cant we just use foom?

Well foom is made in F#; not everyone likes said language; or even care about it;
As said; this would allow them to have Doom in C#.

### What about Visual Basic; can you provide one for that too?

Not sure; maybe???? What name though??? DoomBasic??? BasicDoom??? VBDoom (VisualBasicDoom)???

The game would be just like any other ports; just made in .NET.

Maybe deployment on nuget??? myget??? etc???
